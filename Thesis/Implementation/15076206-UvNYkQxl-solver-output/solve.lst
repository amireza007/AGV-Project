MIQCP status(4): Model was proven to be either infeasible or unbounded.
Computing IIS...
An IIS is a set equations and variables (ie a submodel) which is
infeasible but becomes feasible if any one equation or variable bound
is dropped.

A problem may contain several independent IISs but only one will be
found per run.
Number of equations in the IIS: 5
DefBinarySS(m3,i2,m1,i2) = 1
DefBinarySS(m3,i2,m2,i1) = 1
cnstr_6(m3,i2) = 1
cnstr_8_slack(m3,i2,m1,i2) = 0
cnstr_8_slack(m3,i2,m2,i1) = 0
Number of variables in the IIS: 4
0 < ss(l2,m3,i2,m1,i2)
0 < ss(l2,m3,i2,m2,i1)
0 < ss(l3,m3,i2,m1,i2)
0 < ss(l3,m3,i2,m2,i1)
