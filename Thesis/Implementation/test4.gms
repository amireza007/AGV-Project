This test problem locates points in the unit square such that the
distance between any two points is maximized. For certain number
of points we know optimal arrangements. This knowledge is also
used to find a lower bound on the objective by looking for perfect
square arrangements (suggested by S Dirkse).

Several formulations are presented which serve as good examples to
investigate the performance of different solution approaches. The
problem was originally proposed by Dick van Hertog and has been implemented
by Janos Pinter and used extensively by LGO with 13 and 20 points.

* maxmin2 and maxmin2a without bounds are well suited for LGO
* maxmin1a with bounds is well suited for conopt3 (bounds 200 point is ok)
