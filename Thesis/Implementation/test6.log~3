 ** An equation in the pre-triangular part of the model cannot
    be solved because the critical variable is at a bound.
 
 
    The pre-triangular part of the model has 2 constraints and variables.
 
 ** Infeasible solution. The Preprocessor has determined that the model
    is infeasible.
 
--- DICOPT: Setting up first MIP
--- DICOPT: Relaxed NLP is infeasible

      The Relaxed NLP was infeasible. Please check your model and
      make sure it solves correctly as an RMINLP model. Also
      consider switching to a different RMINLP solver.
