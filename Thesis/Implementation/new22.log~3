      DICOPT terminated prematurely because of a solver
      failure. The listing file will contain additional
      logs from the NLP and MIP solvers which may reveal
      what was the cause of the failure.

--- DICOPT: No integer solution

      No integer solution was found. The relaxed NLP solution
      will be reported.
